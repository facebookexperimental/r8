This is a fork of the D8 dexer and R8 shrinker for use by Buck

Please refer to the upstream repository: https://r8.googlesource.com/r8

This fork isn’t intended to diverge greatly from D8/R8, it’s just a specialized
version for people who use D8 within Buck (and possibly Redex after). **This
repository is not the source of truth**.

We will only consider PRs and issues related to D8/R8's integration with Buck
and Redex in this repo. All other PRs and issues should be sent to
https://r8.googlesource.com/r8
